### Features Left To Implement



## Testing

### Technologies

Python

[Github](https://github.com/) was used for version control to store commit history

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) was used to deploy our final project

### Bugs

#### Solved Bugs

### Remaining Bugs
<br>


### Validator Testing

### Feature Function


<br>
<br>
All functions within my run.py file have been tested throughout this project using print() and PythonTutor to ensure that each function executed as intended.

## Deployment

The site was deployed to the Heroku app through the following steps:
<br>
<br>
1. Ensure that any unnecessary imports (such as import pprint) are deleted before deployment
<br>
<br>
2. Ensure that any input methods used have a new line (\n) at the end of the text due to quirk in the software used to create the mock terminal
<br>
<br>
3. Ensure that any dependencies are added to the requirements.txt file using pip3 freeze > requirements.txt in the terminal. This will update the requirements.txt file
<br>
<br>
4. Create a free Heroku account. Heroku will ask for basic details such as name, email, and role (student)
<br>
<br>
5. Confirm your account by clicking on the confirmation link sent via email
<br>
<br>
6. Create your password and proceed
<br>
<br>
7. Accept terms of service
<br>
<br>
8. Create a new app for your project
<br>
<br>
9. Choose a unique name for your app (non-unique names are not allowed on Heroku)
<br>
<br>
10. Choose your location (USA or Europe) then create the app
<br>
<br>
11. Once the app has been created, click the settings tab in the upper right of the screen
<br>
<br>
12. Add a Config Var based on instructions from Code Institute
<br>
<br>
13. The value for key within Config Var is ‘PORT’ and the value for value is 8000
<br>
<br>
14. If you have used a file on your project that deals with sensitive information, make sure to add this as a Config Var as well. For example, a CREDS.json file would use CREDS as the value for key and the contents of the CREDS.json file as the value
<br>
<br>
15. Add these Config Vars to your app
<br>
<br>
16. Next step is to add two Buildpacks to your app
<br>
<br>
17. These Buildpacks are Python and nodejs. It is very important to ensure that they are in the order of the Python buildpack first, followed by the nodejs buildpack
<br>
<br>
18. Scroll to the top of the page and click the deploy section
<br>
<br>
19. Choose Github as the deployment method
<br>
<br>
20. Scroll down and confirm that we want to connect to Github
<br>
<br>
21. Search for repository name within Github. My project is named “battleships-game22”
<br>
<br>
22. Click the connect button to the right of the screen
<br>
<br>
23. Scroll down, ensure that you have selected the main (master) branch, and click on deploy branch under the Manual Deploy heading
<br>
<br>
24. This will allow you to see the deployment logs as it runs
<br>
<br>
25. Once this process has finished, there will be a message that confirms that the app has been successfully deployed
<br>
<br>
26. At the bottom of the screen, there will be a button to view the deployed project in the mock terminal
<br>
<br>
27. Click the button to view the project
